    builder: understandBuilders,
    tutorial: `# Understand Solutions to Systems

## Big Idea

A system of linear equations is two or more equations considered at the same time. A solution must work in every equation in the system.

## What To Notice

- A solution is usually written as an ordered pair, such as \`(2, 5)\`.
- The ordered pair must make both equations true.
- On a graph, the solution is where the two lines intersect.
- If two lines cross once, the system has one solution.
- A point on only one line is not a solution to the system.

## Worked Example

Check whether \`(3, 4)\` solves:

\`y = x + 1\`

\`y = -2x + 10\`

First equation: \`4 = 3 + 1\`, so \`4 = 4\`.

Second equation: \`4 = -2(3) + 10\`, so \`4 = 4\`.

The point works in both equations, so \`(3, 4)\` is the solution.

## Common Mistake

Do not choose a point just because it lies on one line. A system solution must satisfy every equation.

## Quick Self-Check

Substitute the x-value and y-value into both equations. Both checks must be true.

    builder: graphingBuilders,
    tutorial: `# Solve Systems by Graphing

## Big Idea

To solve a system by graphing, graph both equations on the same coordinate plane. The solution is the point where the lines meet.

## What To Notice

- Each equation makes a line.
- The intersection point is on both lines.
- The x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the intersection form the solution.
- Graphing is especially useful for estimating or checking a solution.
- If the lines are parallel, they never intersect and there is no solution.

## Worked Example

Solve by graphing:

\`y = x + 1\`

\`y = -2x + 10\`

The first line contains \`(0, 1)\`, \`(1, 2)\`, and \`(3, 4)\`.

The second line contains \`(0, 10)\`, \`(1, 8)\`, and \`(3, 4)\`.

Both lines pass through \`(3, 4)\`, so the solution is \`(3, 4)\`.

## Common Mistake

Do not report only the x-value or only the y-value. A system solution is an ordered pair.

## Quick Self-Check

After reading the intersection from the graph, substitute the ordered pair into both equations.

    description: "Solve systems algebraically by replacing one variable with an equivalent expression.",
    builder: substitutionBuilders,
    tutorial: `# Solve Systems by Substitution

## Big Idea

Substitution works by replacing one expression with an equal expression. If both equations tell you what \`y\` equals, you can set those expressions equal to each other.

## What To Notice

- Substitute when one equation already has a variable isolated.
- If \`y = x + 1\` and \`y = -2x + 10\`, then \`x + 1 = -2x + 10\`.
- Solve for one variable first.
- Substitute that value back into either original equation to find the other variable.
- Write the final answer as an ordered pair.

## Worked Example

Solve:

\`y = x + 1\`

\`y = -2x + 10\`

Set the expressions for \`y\` equal:

\`x + 1 = -2x + 10\`

Add \`2x\`:

\`3x + 1 = 10\`

Subtract 1:

\`3x = 9\`

\`x = 3\`

Substitute into \`y = x + 1\`:

\`y = 3 + 1 = 4\`

The solution is \`(3, 4)\`.

## Common Mistake

Do not stop after finding x. Substitute back to find y, then write the ordered pair.

## Quick Self-Check

The final ordered pair should make both original equations true.
