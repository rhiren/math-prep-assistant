# Math-Prep-Assistant Chat Context

Last updated: 2026-07-31

## Purpose

This file captures the main Codex chat context for the project originally developed as `Math-Prep-Assistant` and later renamed to `school-prep-assistant`.

Current constitutional guidance for future changes is preserved separately in [AGENTS.md](/Users/hiren/Documents/github/school-prep-assistant/AGENTS.md). This document should be treated as historical and operational context, while `AGENTS.md` is the authoritative guardrail for future changes.

For significant future work, read `AGENTS.md` first and then use this document for historical rationale, prior decisions, migration context, and current-state handoff notes.

## Project Identity

- Original repo/folder name: `Math-Prep-Assistant`
- Current repo/folder name: `school-prep-assistant`
- Current local path: `/Users/hiren/Documents/github/school-prep-assistant`
- Current remote: `https://github.com/rhiren/school-prep-assistant`

## Core Product Intent

The app was built as a local-first concept-based learning system, initially for Course 2 math, with these repeated goals across the chat:

- Keep the app deterministic, content-driven, and easy to extend.
- Avoid SaaS-style architecture for v1.
- Preserve business logic when making changes.
- Keep UI student-friendly and low-friction.
- Support future expansion beyond math without breaking the current math flow.
- Favor minimal, safe, incremental changes over broad rewrites.

## Persistent Constraints Repeated By The User

- Do not add authentication.
- Do not rewrite the app architecture.
- Do not break existing math functionality while expanding scope.
- Keep IndexedDB/local-first behavior intact even when cloud sync is added.
- Preserve existing progress where possible during migrations and renames.
- Keep test generation deterministic, but leave extension hooks for future difficulty logic.
- Make the experience good for a real student, not a developer demo.

## What Was Built Over Time

### 1. Initial Scaffold

The first major task was to create the app scaffold in React + Vite + TypeScript with routing, domain models, content loading, storage abstractions, and a minimal working UI shell.

Important early design decisions:
- `QuestionSelectionStrategy` was added as a future hook for difficulty-aware selection.
- Answer normalization was designed as a separate utility, not embedded in scoring.
- Question IDs were required to be globally unique.
- `TestSession` explicitly stores answers, current question index, and session status.
- Attempt history is append-only, with progress derived from attempts instead of overwriting prior work.

### 2. Student Test-Taking UX

The test flow was gradually improved to feel usable by a student:

- question progress header
- jump-to-question nav grid
- answered/unanswered visibility
- sticky next/previous/submit controls
- confirmation before submitting with unanswered questions
- flagged vs unanswered visual distinction
- better spacing/readability
- mobile-friendlier layout
- last-question behavior swaps `Next` for `Submit test`

### 3. Results And Dashboard UX

The results page and home/dashboard were reshaped from scaffold/developer language into student-facing UX:

- score summary with correct/incorrect/unanswered
- incorrect-answer review with selected answer, correct answer, and explanation
- expandable explanations
- retry concept test action
- student-focused home page with `Math Practice Dashboard`
- continue practice, next-step recommendation, and progress summary
- logic to recommend the first concept, next concept, or resume in-progress work
- encouraging language and simplified guidance

### 4. Storage Evolution

Storage started as `localStorage` and was upgraded to IndexedDB using `idb`.

Important storage expectations captured in the chat:
- keep higher-level storage/service contracts stable
- migrate old localStorage data into IndexedDB
- maintain separate storage for sessions, attempts, and progress
- keep multiple attempts per concept
- do not change business logic while changing persistence technology

### 5. Answer Normalization

Normalization expanded beyond trivial text cleanup:

- trim whitespace
- lowercase text
- numeric equivalence such as `2` and `2.0`
- ratio normalization
- fraction normalization
- decimal normalization
- cross-type equivalence where appropriate
- simplified-form equivalence for fractions and ratios
- optional feedback tips when the answer is correct but not in the expected form

### 6. Content And Curriculum Work

The Course 2 content was expanded and improved:

- content manifests and tutorials were added
- concept test banks were reviewed and strengthened
- question rigor was recalibrated against weekly benchmark practice/test files
- answer keys and explanations were rechecked
- the biggest quality upgrades were made in unit rates, equivalent ratios, percent relationships, and proportions

### 7. Packaging, Distribution, And Deployment

The project evolved from a web scaffold into multiple delivery modes:

- local launcher script
- Electron desktop support
- packaged local launcher flow and user guide
- support for local file packaging
- GitHub Pages deployment using `gh-pages`

Content was moved under `public/content` and the loader was adapted so the app could serve static content correctly in built deployments.

### 8. Firebase Sync

Firestore was added as a best-effort sync and backup layer on top of local storage.

Intent:
- local-first remains primary
- Firebase is optional and non-blocking
- newest `lastModified` wins during conflict resolution
- the app must keep working if Firebase is unavailable

Placeholder Firebase config was intentionally left in place pending real project credentials.

### 9. Multi-Subject Refactor

The repo was lightly generalized from math-only into subject-ready structure without adding science features:

- project identity changed to `school-prep-assistant`
- content moved to `public/content/math/course2/...`
- manifest fields expanded with `subjectId`, `subjectTitle`, `courseId`, and `courseTitle`
- content loading became subject/course aware
- the current math-first UX was preserved

### 10. Multi-Student Support

The app was later expanded to support multiple student profiles:

- local student profile model
- active student selection
- student-scoped sessions, attempts, and progress
- student-scoped Firebase sync path: `students/{studentId}/progress/current`
- migration path to preserve prior single-user data under `student-1`
- export/import updated to operate per active student

## Current Independent-Session Handoff — 2026-07-24

This section is the current operational handoff. It supersedes any older
`Current Codebase State`, uncommitted-change, placeholder-config, or next-step
notes later in the historical record.

### Repository state

- Branch: `master`
- Remote: `https://github.com/rhiren/school-prep-assistant`
- Course 3 Unit 1 completion should be committed, pushed, and deployed after
  validation.
- The Vite base path is already `/school-prep-assistant/`; the older rename
  follow-up is complete.
- The GitHub Pages publication status of the two commits above was not verified
  in the final Course 3 session. Pushing `master` is not the same as running
  `npm run deploy`, which publishes `dist` through `gh-pages`.

### Active product and content

The app now actively supports:

- Mathematics Course 2
- Mathematics Course 3
- Grade 6 Science

The platform remains:

- React + Vite + TypeScript
- manifest-driven with content under `public/content`
- local-first with IndexedDB as the resilience layer
- optionally synchronized through Firebase/Firestore
- multi-student and student-scoped
- subject-aware and GitHub Pages compatible through `HashRouter`

Firebase now has a real default project configuration for
`school-prep-assistant` with optional Vite environment overrides. It remains a
best-effort sync layer; local storage is still foundational and the app must
continue working when remote sync is unavailable.

### Course 3 current state

Course 3 is for an accelerated Grade 7 learner working at Grade 8
instructional level. Do not collapse `homeGrade` and `instructionalGrade`.

The twelve learner-ready Unit 1 concepts are:

- 20 review questions per concept

Core difficulty distribution is:

- 10 scaffold
- 25 standard
- 15 challenge

Review difficulty distribution is:

- 8 scaffold
- 12 standard

The current active manifest is:

`public/content/math/course3/manifest/course3_manifest.json`

The complete course sequence and release order are in:

`docs/course3_concept_rollout_plan.md`

As of 2026-08-22, Course 3 rollout planning has been realigned to the
Amplify Desmos Math California Grade 8 book sequence used by the student's
school. The active manifest now begins with the first book-aligned unit and
keeps the previously built learner-ready concepts listed above so existing
progress remains stable.
Future build work should follow the book-aligned sequence in
`docs/course3_concept_rollout_plan.md` and preserve existing concept/test IDs
when reusable packs are moved into their book-aligned units.

### Recent learner-facing UI work

Course navigation groups courses beneath their subject and presents Course 3
concepts without making each course appear as a separate subject.

The tutorial renderer in `src/routes/ConceptTutorialPage.tsx` now safely
supports the Markdown structures used by the new lessons:

- headings
- paragraphs
- bold text
- inline code / math notation
- blockquotes
- bulleted and numbered lists with wrapped lines
- tables

It renders React elements rather than injecting raw HTML.

No broader UI redesign is currently required for the next Course 3 unit.

Hidden admin now includes parent-only understanding signals inside the daily and
weekly reports. New test sessions record `answerHistory` for each saved answer;
the report summarizes multiple-choice answer changes, multi-try questions, and
cases where a correct final answer followed multiple distinct choice selections.
Typed-answer keystrokes are marked separately so typing a number or short answer
does not look like guessing. This signal is additive and starts with newly saved
sessions; older attempts remain valid but do not contain historical choice
changes that were not previously stored.

### Current validation baseline

For the current Course 3 working tree, the following passed:

- 18 Vitest files
- 106 automated tests
- `npm run build`
- Course 3 JSON parsing
- globally unique Course 3 question IDs
- exact authored multiple-choice answer identity
- balanced Course 3 multiple-choice correct-answer positions
- unpredictable Course 3 multiple-choice correct-answer position sequencing,
  including a block on three-letter A/B/C-style mini-cycles
- Course 3 template-variety quality gate for new banks
- Course 3 difficulty-progression quality gate so questions do not drop back
  to easier difficulty after harder questions begin
- Course 3 tutorial uniqueness and minimum-length quality gate
- unique option checks
- known-correct mathematical spot checks
- browser verification of the Course 3 grid, concept page, tutorial, and
  assessment counts

The most recent Course 3 audit found 2730 questions and 2730 unique IDs.
An answer-position audit found that the old Course 3 banks had 1119 of 1120
correct answers in option A. Course 3 answer choices were rebalanced so core
banks use a 13/13/12/12 A/B/C/D split and review banks use a 5/5/5/5 split.
A later learner-feedback audit found that balanced banks still followed an
A/B/C/D/A/B/C/D answer-position sequence. Course 3 answer choices were
reshuffled again while preserving authored correct-answer values, explanations,
question IDs, and global answer-position balance. The content repository test
suite now includes Course 3 answer-position balance, answer-sequence, and
template-variety regression guards. A follow-up learner audit found shorter
A/B/C-style mini-cycles, so Course 3 banks were reshuffled under a stricter
gate that blocks any three-step forward answer-position cycle.

A tutorial duplication audit found several Course 3 Unit 2 tutorials had been
authored with the same body and different headings. Those tutorials were
rewritten to be concept-specific, and the content repository test suite now
checks active Course 3 tutorial length and pairwise tutorial similarity.

Several already-published Course 3 banks remain explicit template-variety debt
because they rely too heavily on one normalized question form. That debt is
tracked in `COURSE3_TEMPLATE_VARIETY_DEBT_TEST_SET_IDS` inside
`src/test/contentRepository.test.ts`. Future Course 3 banks should pass the
template-variety gate instead of expanding that debt list.

The twelve Unit 3 assessment packs were regenerated or authored after the
quality gate was added. They now pass the answer-sequence and template-variety
gates without exceptions, with strong normalized question-template variety per
bank.

Existing non-blocking warnings include:

- Vite externalizing `node:fs/promises` for browser compatibility in the
  content repository's environment-specific loader path
- a production bundle-size warning above 500 kB
- expected development logs for Course 2 manifest concepts whose learner-ready
  assets have not yet been built

Do not treat those warnings as authorization for a broad rewrite.

### Exact next task

The next Course 3 rollout task is book Unit 1:

`Unit 1 Mixed Review`

Build it as one complete concept pack before adding it to the active Course 3
manifest. Preserve the same Course 3 release discipline: tutorial first,
50-question core bank, 20-question review bank, validation, then manifest
unlock. Keep the answer-position balance guard green for every new Course 3
test set, and keep the answer-sequence and template-variety guards green
without adding new quality-debt exceptions. Do not rename existing Course 3
concept IDs just to match the book order; move reusable concepts carefully
after book Unit 1 has enough learner-ready content.

### Independent-session startup checklist

1. Read `AGENTS.md` completely.
2. Read this current handoff section.
3. Read `docs/course3_concept_rollout_plan.md`.
4. Run `git status --short` and confirm what, if anything, changed after this
   documentation refresh.
5. Preserve progress, routing, content loading, sync behavior, and the
   manifest-driven structure.
6. Build only the next complete pack; do not mass-enable later roadmap
   concepts.

## Known Deliberate Non-Changes

These were explicitly left alone on purpose:

- `src/storage/indexedDbStorageService.ts` still uses the old DB name for migration compatibility
- Legacy packaged `Math-App/` bundle was later removed from the repo as redundant
- Current local launcher is `Open Math Practice.command`

## Known Caveats Mentioned In Chat

- Electron verification in this environment had some headless/macOS limitations, so web validation was stronger than GUI-window validation.
- Some older content-loader warnings about missing tutorials were noted in the chat at various points; they did not block the main web build validations mentioned in those turns.

## Useful Future Follow-Ups

Current useful follow-ups:

- build `Systems with Infinitely Many Solutions` as the next complete Course 3
  concept pack
- verify or run the GitHub Pages deployment after new `master` content commits
- keep parent-only understanding signals hidden from the student flow and
  local-first/sync-compatible
- keep local launcher and distribution guidance aligned with `dist/` and
  `public/content`
- continue Course 2 readiness work only through its dedicated rollout plan
- continue expanding subjects without disturbing current math, progress, or
  sync behavior

## Short Context Summary For A New Chat

If you need a compact prompt for future work, this is the essence:

`school-prep-assistant` is a local-first React/Vite/TypeScript learning platform
with IndexedDB persistence, deterministic concept tests, exact
multiple-choice scoring, student-friendly tutorials and practice, optional
Firebase sync, multi-student profiles, subject-aware course navigation, and
GitHub Pages support. Active content includes Math Course 2, Math Course 3, and
Grade 6 Science. Course 3 is an accelerated Grade 7 placement into Grade 8
instructional content and has twelve learner-ready Unit 1 concepts, ten
learner-ready Unit 2 concepts, twelve learner-ready Unit 3 concepts, and five
learner-ready Unit 4 concepts, with 2730 validated questions. Units 1, 2, and
3 are complete. The next pack is `Systems with Infinitely Many Solutions`.
Preserve saved-progress compatibility, local-first
behavior, the frozen domain model, and the phased manifest release discipline.
